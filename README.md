Car Price Prediction using Regression Models

This project predicts used car prices based on features like age, powerPS, fuel type, and more. It uses regression models on a cleaned version of the Toyota Corolla dataset.
 Objective
- To explore and predict used car prices using statistical and ML models.
- To compare performance of **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**.
- To evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **R² score**.

Dataset
- Source: Toyota Corolla sample dataset
- Preprocessing:
  - Removed outliers
  - Handled missing values
  - Log-transformed the target variable for normalization

Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regression
-
- Results
- **Linear Regression RMSE:** 0.54  
- **Random Forest RMSE:** ~Better than linear  
- **R² Score:** High on both train/test sets (especially for Random Forest)
